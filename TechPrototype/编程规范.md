## Endless Memories Coding Standards

### Code

- Names of classes, methods, : `PascalCase`.
- Names of local variables, parameters, enumerations, public fields, public properties, namespaces: `camelCase`.
- Names of private, protected, internal and protected internal fields and properties: `camelCase`.
- Naming convention is unaffected by modifiers such as const, static, readonly, etc.

### Files

- Filenames and directory names are `PascalCase`, e.g. `MyFile.cs`.
- Where possible the file name should be the same as the name of the main class in the file, e.g. `MyClass.cs`.
- In general, one core class per file.

### Organization

- Namespace `using` declarations go at the top, before any namespaces.
- Class member ordering:
  - Group class members in the following order:
    - Fields and properties.
    - Methods.

### Whitespace rules

- A maximum of one statement per line.
- A maximum of one assignment per statement.
- Column limit: 100.
- No space between a unary operator and its operand. One space between the operator and each operand of all other operators.



### Example

```
using Photon.Pun;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

// Description:
// This class manages TPS initialization including:
// (1) PhotonViewOwnerships
// (2) Disabling components for FPS player
// (3) Data transfer and synchronization
// (4) Sending signals for actions made by TPS player 
public class PvpTpsManager : MonoBehaviourPun
{
    // Control Canvas for TPS player
    public PvpTpsUiManager pvpTpsUiManager;

    // Send signals including: Making Loud Noise, Repositioning Ghost, Score Update
    public PvpTpsDataManager pvpTpsDataManager;

    [SerializeField] private GameObject chaser;
    [SerializeField] private PvpManager pvpManager;

    // Disable components for FPS player
    [SerializeField] private GameObject fpsPlayer;

    void Start()
    {
        chaser = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("Chaser");
        pvpManager = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("PVP Manager").GetComponent<PvpManager>();
        pvpTpsUiManager = gameObject.GetComponent<PvpTpsUiManager>();
        pvpTpsDataManager = gameObject.GetComponent<PvpTpsDataManager>();
    }

    // Initialize PhotonView Ownership and UiManager
    public void Init(GameObject fps, GameObject tpsPlayer)
    {
        // Transfer ownership if current view is FPS's view, transfer to TPS
        if(photonView.Owner == null || !photonView.Owner.Equals(tpsPlayer.GetPhotonView().Owner))
        {
            photonView.TransferOwnership(tpsPlayer.GetPhotonView().Owner);
        }

        fpsPlayer = fps;
        pvpTpsUiManager.tpsPlayer = tpsPlayer;
        Enable();
        Disable();
    }

    // Enabling components for TPS player
    public void Enable()
    {
        pvpTpsUiManager.Init();
    }

    // Disabling components for FPS player
    public void Disable()
    {
        fpsPlayer.GetComponent<Surviver>().DisableFromOther();
    }
}
```
